    <p class = "intro"> 
        Elon Reeve Musk FRS is an entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; 
        early-stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. 
        With an estimated net worth of around US$243 billion as of February 2022, Musk is the wealthiest person in the world according to both 
        the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the Forbes real-time billionaires list.
        <br>
        Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father, and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University 
        of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17 to avoid conscription. He was enrolled at Queen's University and transferred to the University 
        of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend 
        Stanford University but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. 
        The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 
        2000 to form PayPal. The company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

    <h2> Early life </h2> 
    <h3> Childhood and family </h3> 
    <p>
        Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. His mother is Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian born in 
        Saskatchewan, Canada, but raised in South Africa. His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, 
        consultant, and property developer who was once a half owner of a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika. Musk has a younger brother, 
        Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born 1974). His maternal grandfather, Joshua Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian,
        and Musk has British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. The family was very wealthy in Elon's youth; Errol Musk once said, "We had so much 
        money at times we couldn't even close our safe". After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria and elsewhere,
        a choice he made two years after the divorce and subsequently regretted. Musk has become estranged from his father, whom he describes as "a terrible 
        human being... Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done." He has a half-sister and a half-brother on his father's side. 
        Elon attended an Anglican Sunday school in his youth.
        <br>
        Around age 10, Musk developed an interest in computing and video games and acquired a Commodore VIC-20. He learned computer 
        programming using a manual and, at age 12, sold the code of a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar to PC and Office Technology 
        magazine for approximately $500. An awkward and introverted child, Musk was bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized after 
        a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs. He attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School and Bryanston High School before graduating 
        from Pretoria Boys High School.

    <h3> Education </h3> 
    <p>
        Aware that it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.
        While awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months; this allowed him to avoid mandatory service in the 
        South African military. Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, and lived with a second-cousin in Saskatchewan for a year, working odd jobs at a 
        farm and lumber-mill. In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, 
        where he graduated in 1995 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics and a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics.
        <br>
        In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched 
        electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a Doctor of 
        Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in materials science at Stanford University in California. Musk attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received 
        a response to his inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead to join the Internet boom and launch an Internet startup.
